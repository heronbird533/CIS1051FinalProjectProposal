# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO: Dig Dug Recreation using Pygame

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO: I would like to create a 2D game using pygame to help me learn the concepts and steps in order to do so. I aim to learn the basics before trying to change the theme or adding fancy music or any other graphics. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO: I plan to create a dig dug style arcade game using pygame. The game will feature a player thant digs through blocks of turn to make tunnels and avoid enemies coming toward the player similar to the game. As the player moves, the dirt tile turns blank to make a tunnel where theplayer can either cut through more dirt blocks or backtrack to another way to avoid an enemy. The program will include player movement, enemies using random movements, and detection of the two. If I have time, I will shift my focus to adding more advanced things like a score, levels or a theme. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable: N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable: N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO: A good outcome would be me successfully running the game and figuring out how to add some sort of graphic to resemble the original game. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO: If all goes well hopefully I will be able to figure out how to add music. If I can get the basics down, I would love to mess around and do a spooky graveyard theme. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO: I just recently started watching stranger things again, and noticed they play dig dug in the arcade. I thought it would be cool to try and figure out how to do themed character and have demogorgons chasing after them. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO: In order to make this project more bearable it's crucial to divide it into parts. First, I am unfamiliar with pygame so I will go on the website and learn more about how it helps the game with movements. Also, figure out how to create a 2d game and update it. I will have to find a way to include player input, enemy positioning so I'll look in sprite handling to replace shapes with actual characters and graphics. Once I learn the basics and it runs without problem I will research how to add sound and how to organize the files so if I want to edit the theme it is organized.
