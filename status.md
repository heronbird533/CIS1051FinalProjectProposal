Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I recreated a "soft" version of dig dug in the original looking format. It resembled the game but as I ran it I noticed some differences so I fixed them in this version. I then changed the grid to more darker colors to represent the upside down. I originally had one enemy but created multiple and had then move along tunnels. I also added a clock, lives, and title screen where the game won't run until you hit enter. The object of the game is to the reveal the image, aka finish the grid. If not the game ends by running out of lives or the timer running out. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still plan to add an image and audio I got from pixabay. I would also like to fix a few little things in the game. Also, maybe making the enemies worth points so you can finish the game without collecting all the enemies but you don't get the high score. I will have to mess around with that. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Issues with the image and audio but explained in previous questions. Will have to meet about that.
