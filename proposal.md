# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

TODO 
I would like to do a 2D game maybe similar to flappy birds or mario with scoring points or collecting something.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

TODO
I do not plan to work with any other classmates.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

TODO
Nothing specific, just wondering how I can make the game as interesting as possible with little coding knowledge about creating games.
